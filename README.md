# Phase 2 Project

## Description

This simple application is designed to utilize the Jikan API (https://jikan.moe/) to display search results from MyAnimeList (MAL) (https://myanimelist.net/). The search form will display results either for Anime titles or Manga titles but it will only display the first 25 results from a query. Another feature of the site is the ability to switch from dark to light mode, depending on personal preference.

## Usage

1. Select from the drop down menu whether you would like to search for an Anime or a Manga title.

2. Input title name into the search field (e.g. Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, etc).

3. Hit 'Submit'.

4. Search results will display on the page.

5. Clicking on "Learn More" will direct you to the MyAnimeList page for the specified anime/manga.

6. Repeat steps 1-3 to display new search results.

## Project Status

9/14/22 - Version 0.1 Complete

Will be put on hold until there is time to implement future planned features.

## Planned Features

1. Display Anime/Manga Information without redirecting to the MAL page
    - Information such as the title, synopsis, genre, air date, etc.

2. Display more than the first 25 search results either by:
    - Displaying all search results on one page
    - Ability to page through results, 25 at a time
